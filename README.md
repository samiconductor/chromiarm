# ChromiARM

ChromiARM aims to provide a minimal browsing experience for ARM systems. It's really just an [electron](http://electron.atom.io/) app and with a basic browser UI and functionality. It's in a pre-release state at the moment so you will need to run it with node. See the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for planned features.

## Running ChromiARM

- `git clone https://github.com/samiconductor/chromiarm.git`
- `cd chromiarm`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
